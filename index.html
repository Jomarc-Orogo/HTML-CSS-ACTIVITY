                There are times when I'm lying in my bed
                How I bellow and cry from this stupid gate
                And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
                Almost rubbed-down, swelling
                As I keep on dipping my face in these cold hands of mine
                Heaven knows how embittered I am
                'Cause this angel has flown away from me
                Leaving me with drunken misery
                I should have clipped her wings
                And made her mine for all eternity
                Now, this angel has flown away from me
                Thought I had the strength to set her free
                Did what I did because I love her so
                Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
                I'm so tired, I feel like catching 40 winks
                Being up all night in this elbow room
                That puts me in a trance
                Where hopes and dreams come true
                Now, my lips are burning
                And my eyes are hurting
                From these fumes I make, still, I light another cigarette
                Just to pass my time, oh
                Heaven knows how embittered I am
                'Cause this angel has flown away from me

                Did what I did because I love her so
                Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
                I'm so tired, I feel like catching 40 winks
                Being up all night in this elbow room
                That puts me in a trance
                Where hopes and dreams come true
                Now, my lips are burning
                And my eyes are hurting
                From these fumes I make, still, I light another cigarette
                Just to pass my time, oh
                Heaven knows how embittered I am
                'Cause this angel has flown away from me
                Leaving me with drunken misery
                I should have clipped her wings

                There are times when I'm lying in my bed
                How I bellow and cry from this stupid gate
                And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
                Almost rubbed-down, swelling
                As I keep on dipping my face in these cold hands of mine
                Heaven knows how embittered I am

                Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
                Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
                There are times when I'm lying in my bed
                How I bellow and cry from this stupid gate
                And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
                Almost rubbed-down, swelling
                As I keep on dipping my face in these cold hands of mine
                Heaven knows how embittered I am
                'Cause this angel has flown away from me
                Leaving me with drunken misery
                I should have clipped her wings
                And made her mine for all eternity
                Now, this angel has flown away from me
                Thought I had the strength to set her free
                Did what I did because I love her so
                Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
                I'm so tired, I feel like catching 40 winks
                Being up all night in this elbow room
                That puts me in a trance
                Where hopes and dreams come true
                Now, my lips are burning
                And my eyes are hurting
                From these fumes I make, still, I light another cigarette
                Just to pass my time, oh
                Heaven knows how embittered I am

                Being up all night in this elbow room
                That puts me in a trance
                Where hopes and dreams come true
                Now, my lips are burning
                And my eyes are hurting
                From these fumes I make, still, I light another cigarette
                Just to pass my time, oh
                Heaven knows how embittered I am
                'Cause this angel has flown away from me
                Leaving me with drunken misery
                I should have clipped her wings
                And made her mine for all eternity
                Now, this angel has flown away from me
                Thought I had the strength to set her free
                Did what I did because I love her so
                Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
                Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
                There are times when I'm lying in my bed
                How I bellow and cry from this stupid gate
                And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
                Almost rubbed-down, swelling
                As I keep on dipping my face in these cold hands of mine
                Heaven knows how embittered I am
                'Cause this angel has flown away from me
                Leaving me with drunken misery
                I should have clipped her wings
                And made her mine for all eternity

                Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
                I'm so tired, I feel like catching 40 winks
                Being up all night in this elbow room
                That puts me in a trance
                Where hopes and dreams come true
